# Version
3.0

# Installation

Download the latest .exe and run it.

# Build
If you want to build the code yourself, make sure you have Python 3.7 and pip3 installed.
Clone the repo, cd into it, and type

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, to generate an .exe output, type
```
pyinstaller crosshair.spec
```

You should see a crosshair.exe in a newly-created dist folder in that directory.
